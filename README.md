# 8-Bit CPU


## Build
Clone the project by:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/empitrix/8bitcpu
cd ./8bitcpu
```

To build the project using `gnu make` run:
```bash
make
```
After that you will have `./cpu`.

> [!NOTE]
> currently this project is for unix-like operating systems only.


## Usage
For example to use the project run:
```bash
./cpu -p ./examples/pattern.bin
```

Which executes the file [`pattern.asm`](https://github.com/Empitrix/assembler/blob/master/examples/pattern.asm) that generated by [**Assembler**](https://github.com/Empitrix/assembler).

Or if you wish to see the instructions step by step use `-s` flag:
```bash
./cpu -p ./examples/pattern.bin -s
```
In stepping mode if you press `q` the program will end.


## CPU Specifications:
### Memory
- 16 bytes of RAM (Addresses `0x10` to `0x1F`)
- 256 bytes of ROM (Addresses `0x00` to `0xFF`)

### Registers
- 10 special-purpose registers (Addresses `0x00` to `0x09`)
  - Register `0x06`: GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)

### Opcodes
- `BSF f, b`: Bit set forward (`0101 bbb fffff`)
- `BCF f, b`: Bit clear file (`0100 bbb fffff`)
- `GOTO k`: Unconditional Branch (`101k kkkk kkkk`)
- `NOP`: No Operation (`0000 0000 0000`)

### Opcode Details
- `BSF`: Bit clear forward: set given bit from given register to 1
- `BCF`: Bit clear file: set given bit from given register to 0
- `GOTO`: Goto given lable address
- `NOP`: No Operation (small delay)
