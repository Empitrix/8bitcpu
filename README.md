# 8-Bit CPU


## Build
Clone the project by:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/empitrix/8bitcpu
cd ./8bitcpu
```

To build the project using `gnu make` run:
```bash
make
```
After that you will have `./cpu`.

> [!NOTE]
> currently this project is for unix-like operating systems only.


## Usage
For example to use the project run:
```bash
./cpu -p ./examples/pattern.bin
```

Which executes the file [`pattern.asm`](https://github.com/Empitrix/assembler/blob/master/examples/pattern.asm) that generated by [**Assembler**](https://github.com/Empitrix/assembler).

Or if you wish to see the instructions step by step use `-s` flag:
```bash
./cpu -p ./examples/pattern.bin -s
```
In stepping mode if you press `q` the program will end.


## Flags
| Flag        | Name          | Description                       |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| `-s`        | Stepping Mode | Clock pulse with keyboard keys    |
| `-f <num>`  | Frequency     | Clock frequency from 1 to 1000000 |
| `-p <path>` | Program       | Path to `.bin` file from [`assembler`](https://github.com/empitrix/assembler) |
